* qnap-finder
=============

This is a simple program to find out the presence (and the IP) of a QNAP NAS box on
a network. I have tested with a TS-410.



* Disclaimer
============
This program is a work in progress and isn't guaranteed to work with all QNAP devices.
Although this is meant to be a replacement for the Windows/Mac versions of QNAP finder,
it is not guaranteed to work that way.


* Data from the windows version of QFinder
==========================================
The QNAP Finder when run(on MS Windows), sends a UDP broadcast packet on the network
to the multicast address(255.255.255.255) upon which, any QNAP NAS box active on the
network responds with it's version information, hostname and other details.

I noticed (when sniffing with Wireshark), that the QNAP Finder app, sends the broadcast
message several times (15 to be precise) from the time it is launched until it stops
querying further, with the following data:

00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 43 6c  00 00 01 00 00 00 25 04 ......Cl ......%.

000000E0  00 08 9b c3 ec 6a 43 6c  02 00 05 00 00 00 25 04 .....jCl ......%.

I haven't figured out the difference between the message:

00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 43 6c  00 00 01 00 00 00 25 04 ......Cl ......%.

and

00000020  00 08 9b c3 ec 6a 43 6c  02 00 05 00 00 00 25 04 .....jCl ......%.


Both the messages are 16 bytes long.

I used tcpdump to capture data from my linux box:

# tcpdump -vvv -i wlan0 -w cap_from_linux.pcap -n "broadcast or multicast"

Please find the file `cap_from_linux.pcap` in the repository.
