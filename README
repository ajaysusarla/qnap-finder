* qnap-finder
=============

This is a simple program to find out the presence (and the IP) of a QNAP NAS box on
a network. I have tested with a TS-410.



* Disclaimer
============
This program is a work in progress and isn't guaranteed to work with all QNAP devices.
Although this is meant to be a replacement for the Windows/Mac versions of QNAP finder,
it is not guaranteed to work that way.


* Data from the windows version of QFinder
==========================================
The QNAP Finder when run(on MS Windows), sends a UDP broadcast packet on the network
to the multicast address(255.255.255.255) upon which, any QNAP NAS box active on the
network responds with it's version information, hostname and other details.

I noticed (when sniffing with Wireshark), that the QNAP Finder app, sends the broadcast
message several times (15 to be precise) from the time it is launched until it stops
querying further, with the following data:

There are two kinds of messages that are sent:

This is a query of sorts. When sent, the NAS box responds with a brief message:

Both the messages are 16 bytes long.

I used tcpdump to capture data from my linux box:

# tcpdump -vvv -i wlan0 -w cap_from_linux.pcap -n "broadcast or multicast"

Please find the file `cap_from_linux.pcap` in the repository.
